I am an MSc student at University of Toronto supervised by [Prof. Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) 
working on improving simulation for robotics. Prior to this I worked as a Software Developer at [Unity](https://unity.com/)
for 2 years working primarily on the creation of high fidelity LiDAR simulations in the Unity game engine.

During my undergraduate studies I worked on
developing adversarial scenarios for autonomous driving under the supervision of Prof. Gregory Dudek and
Prof. Florian Shkurti, currently my research is focused on extending this work.

Since I am doing my research in simulation, I am naturally interested in topics from
computer graphics, robotics and physics simulation.

Currently, I'm working on state of the art sensor simulation at [Waabi](https://waabi.ai/).

Previously, I was an MSc student at University of Toronto supervised by [Prof. Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) 
working on novel simulation techinques with applications in robotics. Prior to this, I worked as a Software Developer at [Unity](https://unity.com/)
for 2 years working primarily on the creation of high fidelity LiDAR simulations in the Unity game engine.

During my undergraduate studies I worked on
developing adversarial scenarios for autonomous driving under the supervision of Prof. Gregory Dudek and
Prof. Florian Shkurti, currently my research is focused on extending this work.

As evident from my experience, I am naturally interested in topics in the fields of computer graphics, robotics and physics simulation.
